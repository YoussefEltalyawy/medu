# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the discover page to provide comprehensive content discovery for movies and TV shows in the user's selected target language with pagination and advanced search capabilities. The current implementation only fetches a limited number of content from the first page. This enhancement will allow users to discover all available movies and TV shows in their selected target language through paginated results and provide robust search functionality to find specific content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to see all available movies and TV shows in my selected target language, so that I have access to the complete catalog for language learning purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the discover page loads THEN the system SHALL first check the user's selected target language from their profile
2. WHEN the user's target language is determined THEN the system SHALL fetch and display both movies and TV shows in that language
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL show movies and TV shows that are either originally in the target language OR have the target language as an available option
4. WHEN fetching content THEN the system SHALL retrieve all available movies and TV shows through pagination rather than limiting to the first page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user browsing content, I want to see paginated results with smooth loading, so that I can browse through large collections of movies and TV shows without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the first page of results (20 items per page including both movies and TV shows)
2. WHEN the user scrolls to the bottom of the page THEN the system SHALL automatically load the next page of results
3. WHEN loading additional pages THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator at the bottom of the page
4. WHEN all available pages have been loaded THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no more content is available
5. WHEN loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide a retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user looking for specific content, I want to search for any movie or TV show in my target language and see relevant results, so that I can quickly find content I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL search through all available movies and TV shows in the target language (not just the currently loaded ones)
2. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL search by title, overview, and cast information for both movies and TV shows
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display them in a paginated format
4. WHEN the search query is cleared THEN the system SHALL return to the default content discovery view in the target language
5. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message suggesting alternative search terms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language filtering to work consistently across all features, so that my language preference is respected throughout the discovery experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes their target language in their profile THEN the discover page SHALL automatically update to show movies and TV shows in the new language
2. WHEN filtering by language THEN the system SHALL prioritize content originally in that language first, followed by content with that language available
3. WHEN displaying mixed language results THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the original language and available language options for each movie and TV show
4. IF no content is available in the selected language THEN the system SHALL display a message explaining this and suggest alternative languages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search and pagination to work together seamlessly, so that I can search through large result sets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search with many results THEN the system SHALL paginate the search results
2. WHEN loading more search results THEN the system SHALL maintain the search query and continue loading relevant results
3. WHEN switching between search and browse modes THEN the system SHALL reset pagination appropriately
4. WHEN the user modifies the search query THEN the system SHALL reset to the first page of new results
